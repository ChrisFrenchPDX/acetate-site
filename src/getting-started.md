For now refer to the [Acetate Sample](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample) and the guides for [Grunt](/documentation/grunt-plugin/), [Gulp](/documentation/gulp-usage), or the [command line](/documentation/command-line).

You can also look at the [source for this site](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-site) which is written in Acetate and built using Grunt.
