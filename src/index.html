# Install

To install Acetate, install the command line runner globally and Acetate locally in your project :

```bash
npm install acetate --save-dev
```

```bash
npm install -g acetate-cli
```

Then create a config file named `acetate.conf.js` in your project. Here's a simple example:

```js
module.exports = function (acetate) {
  acetate.global('config', {
    environment: 'dev',
  });

  acetate.layout('**/*', 'layouts/_layout:content');
};
```

Then, to build your site just run:

```bash
actetate
```

If you'd like to use the built-in server, use:

```bash
acetate server
```

If you'd like to start from an existing Acetate project, you can use the [sample site](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample):

```bash
npm install -g acetate-cli
git clone https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample.git acetate-sample
cd acetate-sample
npm install
acetate-server --open
```

# Using Grunt

Acetate also works quite well with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). In your grunt project just run:

```bash
npm install grunt-acetate --save-dev
```

And load it in the `Gruntfile.js`:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-acetate');
```

In the task, you can have multiple targets. A common setup might be one task that just builds (for deployment) and one task that runs a server (for development):

```js
'acetate': {
  build: {
    config: 'acetate.conf.js'
  },
  watch: {
    config: 'acetate.conf.js',
    options: {
      watch: true,
      server: true
    }
  }
}
```

Then, you can run a development server on port 3000:

```bash
grunt acetate:watch
```

This way you can use grunt-acetate as part of a larger Gruntfile where each module has one responsibility. Imagemin compresses your images, sass compiles your css, and uglify/concat create your production javascript. See [this site's Gruntfile](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-site/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for an example.
