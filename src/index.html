# A Node.js Static Site Generator

After using almost a dozen static site generators, the same problems kept presenting themselves: hard to extend, not flexible enough, a pain to add data, and too slow. Acetate is a static site generator for people who wrestle with static site generators.

<div class="block-group padded">
  <div class="block one-third">
    <img src="{{relativePath}}assets/img/focus.svg" alt="Focused">
    <h3>Focus</h3>
    <p class="small">Acetate doesn't do everything for you. It only handles html, markdown, and data. That keeps it fast, simple, and effective.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block one-third">
    <img src="{{relativePath}}assets/img/extend.svg" alt="Extensions">
    <h3>Extentions</h3>
    <p class="small">Write custom extensions in plain old JavaScript and use Nunjucks to write your own template tags.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="block one-third">
    <img src="{{relativePath}}assets/img/data.svg" alt="Data">
    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p class="small">Acetate accepts JSON, YML, and JS out of the box. Add data syncronously or asycronously with custom extensions.</p>

# Install

To install Acetate, just use the npm module:

```bash
npm install -g acetate-cli
```

Then create a config file named `acetate.conf.js` in your project. Here's a simple example:

```js
module.exports = function (acetate) {
  acetate.global('config', {
    environment: 'dev',
  });

  acetate.layout('**/*', 'layouts/_layout:content');

  acetate.options.src = 'source/';
  acetate.options.dest = 'build/';
};
```

Then, to build your site to the `build/` folder, just type:

```bash
actetate
```

If you'd like to use the built-in server, use:

```bash
acetate server
```

If you'd like to start from an existing acetate site, you can use the [sample site](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample):

```
git clone https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-sample.git
cd acetate-sample
acetate-server
```

# Using Grunt

Acetate also works quite well with [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). In your grunt project just run:

```bash
npm install grunt-acetate --save-dev
```

And load it in the `Gruntfile.js`:

```js
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-acetate');
```

In the task, you can have multiple targets. A common setup might be one task that just builds (for deployment) and one task that runs a server (for development):

```js
'acetate': {
  build: {
    config: 'acetate.conf.js'
  },
  watch: {
    config: 'acetate.conf.js',
    options: {
      watch: true,
      server: true
    }
  }
}
```

Then, you can run a development server on port 3000:

```
grunt acetate:watch
```

This way you can use grunt-acetate as part of a larger Gruntfile where each module has one responsibility. Imagemin compresses your images, sass compiles your css, and uglify/concat create your production javascript. See [this site's Gruntfile](https://github.com/patrickarlt/acetate-site/blob/master/Gruntfile.js) for an example.
