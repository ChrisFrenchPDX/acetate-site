title: Introduction to Pages
---

Any files ending in `.md`, `.markdown` and `.html` in your `src` folder are automatically loaded by Acetate and turned into pages. When you site is built Acetate processes these pages, runs your extensions and then builds the resulting output.

Pages whose filenames begin with `_` are ignored from builds but can be used as layouts or partials.
